# Problem 26: Remove Duplications from Sorted Array


#### Difficulty: Easy

#### Problem

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with
constant memory.

#### Example

<pre>

Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
being 1 and 2 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the new
length.
