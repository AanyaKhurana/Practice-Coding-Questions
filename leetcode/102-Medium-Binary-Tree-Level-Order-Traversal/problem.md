# Problem 102: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

#### Example

<pre>
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
</pre>
