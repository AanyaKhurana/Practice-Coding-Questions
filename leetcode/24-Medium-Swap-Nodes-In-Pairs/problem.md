#### Difficulty: Medium

#### Problem

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

#### Example

<pre>


For example,
Given ```1->2->3->4```, you should return the list as ```2->1->4->3```.
